## About me

I am Alejandra, I have always preferred my second name, it feels less serious than "Paula", I have always felt at home on the computer, my safe place if you will, which is how I ended up here, I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, I love ttrpgs they are my main creative outlet and I hope to use my technical knowledge to help my favorite hobby become even more accessible to everyone.
