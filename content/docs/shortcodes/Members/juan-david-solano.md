## About me

I am a sentient being who places a particularly high value on this quality. I am interested in living and creating valuable experiences for myself and other sentient or thinking beings. I am passionate about the movement of the human body, temporal, spatial and conceptual structures. I cultivate mushrooms, practice parkour, make music, write poetry and aphorisms, and try to educate myself as a scientist. I dream of doing decentralized science with people who cannot approach the university or even school, with the abolition of private property, with disentangling ourselves from the nonsense of freedom proposed by Stuart Mill, with animal-free food, and with my own death.
