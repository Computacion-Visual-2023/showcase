## Color Blindness Types

### 1. Red- green type
					

#### Protanomaly
    
Due to the unusual occurrence of red cone pigments. In this type, red, orange, and yellow appear green, and the colors are not bright. This condition is benign and usually does not affect daily life.

#### Protanopia 

In this type, the red cone pigments stop working, and the red will appears as black. Some variants of orange, yellow and green all appear as yellow.

Some opticians prefer to use a reverse color blind test to diagnose colour vision deficiency. In this test, the patients are asked to identify the coloured object in the pallet within dynamic colored background.

#### Deuteranomaly

This is the most common type found in people. It has an unusual green cone pigment. Yellow and green appear as red, purple and blue are difficult to identify. This condition is benign and usually does not affect daily life.

#### Deuteranopia 
In this, green cone pigments stop working. They see red colors as brownish-yellow and green as dark yellow.

### 2. Blue-Yellow Type

Blue-yellow type is rarer than red-green. In this, the blue cone pigment (triton) is either absent or has a limited function. There are two types of blue-yellow type.

#### Tritanomaly 
Blue cone pigments have less function. The blue color appears as green, and it cannot be easy to differentiate from pink to yellow and red.

#### Tritanopia 
People with Tritanopia lack blue cone cells. Blue appears green in this, and the yellow color looks like purple or light brown.

### 3. Full (Monochromacy) Type

People with full type (monochromacy) do not see any colors, and their clarity of vision can also be affected. There are two types of monochromacy

#### Cone monochromacy

In this, two or three cone cell pigments do not work. People with cone monochromacy have difficulty distinguishing between colors because the brain needs signals from different types of cones to see. This comparison is not possible when only one type of cone works.

#### Rod Monochromacy

It is present from birth. It does not contain any of the available pigments of cone cells. People with rod monochromacy see the world in black, white, and gray. People with rod monochromacy are photophobic and very uncomfortable in bright environments.

## Color spaces

### CIEXYZ

The XYZ color space or CIEXYZ was developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931. It mathematically describes how colors are perceived by the human eye and how they can be represented in a three-dimensional coordinate system.

CIEXYZ is based on the idea that any color that can be perceived by the human eye can be generated by a combination of three imaginary primary colors: X, Y, and Z. These primary colors are called "color matching functions" and are based on the spectral response of the three types of cone cells in the human eye. In the XYZ color space, each color is represented by three numerical values, known as tristimulus coordinates.


### LMS

LMS is a color space that is used to describe the response of the three types of cone cells in the human eye to different wavelengths of light. It was developed by John A. Hunt, Vivianne C. Smith, and Lorne A. Johnston in 1992, and is based on the previous work of Pointer and Estevez.

In this color space, LMS stands for the three types of cone cells in the human eye: L for long that responds to red light, M for medium that responds to green light, and S for short that responds to blue-violet light. The LMS color space describes how these cone cells respond to different wavelengths of light and how they combine to produce different colors.

## Process

For this work we focused on simulating and correcting three types of color blindness, Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia.
The Simulation starts by taking the RGBA values of the loaded image and saving them on 4 different arrays, then we eliminate the alpha channel by transforming the RGB values to the values with the correct opacity.

R = ((1 - a) * 255) + (a * r)

G = ((1 - a) * 255) + (a * g)

B = ((1 - a) * 255) + (a * b)

Then thos values get translated into the LMS color space
