# Methodology

## 1. Color spaces

### CIEXYZ

The XYZ color space or CIEXYZ was developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931. It mathematically describes how colors are perceived by the human eye and how they can be represented in a three-dimensional coordinate system.

CIEXYZ is based on the idea that any color that can be perceived by the human eye can be generated by a combination of three imaginary primary colors: X, Y, and Z. These primary colors are called "color matching functions" and are based on the spectral response of the three types of cone cells in the human eye. In the XYZ color space, each color is represented by three numerical values, known as tristimulus coordinates.


### LMS

LMS is a color space that is used to describe the response of the three types of cone cells in the human eye to different wavelengths of light. It was developed by John A. Hunt, Vivianne C. Smith, and Lorne A. Johnston in 1992, and is based on the previous work of Pointer and Estevez.

In this color space, LMS stands for the three types of cone cells in the human eye: L for long that responds to red light, M for medium that responds to green light, and S for short that responds to blue-violet light. The LMS color space describes how these cone cells respond to different wavelengths of light and how they combine to produce different colors.

### RGBA

The RGBA color model is a color model used in visual computing for the representation of colors in digital images. Each pixel of an RGBA image is composed of four components: red (R), green (G), blue (B), and alpha (A).

The R component represents the intensity of the red color of the pixel, the G component represents the intensity of the green color, and the B component represents the intensity of the blue color. All of these components have a numerical range of 0 to 255. The A component represents the transparency of the pixel, with values ranging from 0 to 1.

The combination of these four components allows for the creation of a wide variety of colors and visual effects in digital images.
