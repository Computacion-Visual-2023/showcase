## Tool uses

This tool that applies color transformations to images provides a solution for people with color blindness and can be used in various settings. One of them is accessing websites that lack a user-friendly design for people with this disability, making it difficult to interpret the visual elements on the page. Additionally, this tool can also be used to solve image Captcha tests, commonly used as a human identification verification mechanism on websites.

Another area where this tool can be applied is in technical and scientific education, where explanatory graphics are often used. However, these graphics are usually developed without considering the difficulty individuals with color blindness may have accessing the information presented. The color transformation tool for images improves the interpretation of these graphics, helping to overcome this obstacle for people with this condition. In general, this tool can be used in any computing environment where visual elements must be interpreted by people with color blindness.

## Limitations and Difficulties:

Finding research papers related to the diagnosis, simulation, and treatment of color blindness proved to be a challenging task. However, we were fortunate to find one paper on color blindness simulation with experimental validation for the three types of CVD, and we based our work on it. Our simulation tool allows us to validate specific color corrections for each type of color blindness. While we have not yet been able to perform tests with individuals who have this condition, we consider it important to do so to ensure the tool's optimal performance.

Our primary focus has been on developing simulation and correction tools for images and videos. However, we currently do not have a diagnostic tool or an automatic adjustment method.

Our video tools are capable of transforming colors for webm, mp4, and mov formats. However, we have limitations when it comes to downloading different types of video formats. Currently, our tools only support downloading gif, which is not a true video format.

Our tools run on software, and currently, we are not utilizing the full hardware power for rendering our transformations, which is a critical issue when it comes to working with videos.

## Future works

1. Hardware acceleration: Implementing hardware acceleration could significantly improve the speed and efficiency of your app's video rendering capabilities.

2. Diagnostic tool: Developing a diagnostic tool could help users identify their specific type of color blindness, allowing for more accurate and targeted color corrections.

3. Automatic adjustment: Implementing an automatic adjustment method could save users time and effort by automatically applying color corrections based on the identified type of color blindness.

4. Support for additional video formats: Adding support for additional video formats, such as AVI or MPEG, could make your app more versatile and accessible to a wider range of users.

5. Integration with eye-tracking technology: Integrating eye-tracking technology could help your app accurately detect which areas of an image or video need color correction, improving the overall quality of the final product.

6. Cloud-based rendering: Utilizing cloud-based rendering could improve the speed and efficiency of your app's video rendering capabilities by offloading the processing load to remote servers.

7. User testing: Performing tests with individuals who have color blindness could help ensure that your app is effective in real-world scenarios and identify any areas for improvement.
