## Tool uses

This tool that applies color transformations to images provides a solution for people with color blindness and can be used in various settings. One of them is accessing websites that lack a user-friendly design for people with this disability, making it difficult to interpret the visual elements on the page. Additionally, this tool can also be used to solve image Captcha tests, commonly used as a human identification verification mechanism on websites.

Another area where this tool can be applied is in technical and scientific education, where explanatory graphics are often used. However, these graphics are usually developed without considering the difficulty individuals with color blindness may have accessing the information presented. The color transformation tool for images improves the interpretation of these graphics, helping to overcome this obstacle for people with this condition. In general, this tool can be used in any computing environment where visual elements must be interpreted by people with color blindness.
