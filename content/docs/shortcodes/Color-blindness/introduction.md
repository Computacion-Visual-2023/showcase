# Introduction

During our research, we found that the popular video game known as **Fortnite** has a "colorblind mode" function, which is a feature that provides assistance to players who have difficulty distinguishing certain colors in the game, in order to better distinguish different shades. This tool offers three options: "protanopia," "deuteranopia," and "tritanopia," which are adjusted to cover different types of color blindness.

Each of these options alters the colors in the game, allowing players to have better visual perception. For example, the "protanopia" option changes the red colors in the game so that players can better distinguish between these shades. On the other hand, the "deuteranopia" option adjusts the green tones, while the "tritanopia" option changes the blue and orange tones.

This served as inspiration for us to work on color transformation in images so that people with different types of color blindness could have a better experience when viewing them.

# Color Blindness Types

## 1. Red- green type
					

### Protanomaly
    
Due to the unusual occurrence of red cone pigments. In this type, red, orange, and yellow appear green, and the colors are not bright. This condition is benign and usually does not affect daily life.

### Protanopia 

In this type, the red cone pigments stop working, and the red will appears as black. Some variants of orange, yellow and green all appear as yellow.

Some opticians prefer to use a reverse color blind test to diagnose colour vision deficiency. In this test, the patients are asked to identify the coloured object in the pallet within dynamic colored background.

### Deuteranomaly

This is the most common type found in people. It has an unusual green cone pigment. Yellow and green appear as red, purple and blue are difficult to identify. This condition is benign and usually does not affect daily life.

### Deuteranopia 
In this, green cone pigments stop working. They see red colors as brownish-yellow and green as dark yellow.

## 2. Blue-Yellow Type

Blue-yellow type is rarer than red-green. In this, the blue cone pigment (triton) is either absent or has a limited function. There are two types of blue-yellow type.

### Tritanomaly 
Blue cone pigments have less function. The blue color appears as green, and it cannot be easy to differentiate from pink to yellow and red.

### Tritanopia 
People with Tritanopia lack blue cone cells. Blue appears green in this, and the yellow color looks like purple or light brown.

## 3. Full (Monochromacy) Type

People with full type (monochromacy) do not see any colors, and their clarity of vision can also be affected. There are two types of monochromacy

### Cone monochromacy

In this, two or three cone cell pigments do not work. People with cone monochromacy have difficulty distinguishing between colors because the brain needs signals from different types of cones to see. This comparison is not possible when only one type of cone works.

### Rod Monochromacy

It is present from birth. It does not contain any of the available pigments of cone cells. People with rod monochromacy see the world in black, white, and gray. People with rod monochromacy are photophobic and very uncomfortable in bright environments.
