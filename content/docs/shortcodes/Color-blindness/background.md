# Background

During our research, we found that the popular video game known as **Fortnite** has a "colorblind mode" function, which is a feature that provides assistance to players who have difficulty distinguishing certain colors in the game, in order to better distinguish different shades. This tool offers three options: "protanopia," "deuteranopia," and "tritanopia," which are adjusted to cover different types of color blindness.

Each of these options alters the colors in the game, allowing players to have better visual perception. For example, the "protanopia" option changes the red and green colors in the game so that players can better distinguish between these shades. On the other hand, the "deuteranopia" option adjusts the green and red tones, while the "tritanopia" option changes the blue and orange tones.

This served as inspiration for us to work on color transformation in images so that people with different types of color blindness could have a better experience when viewing them.
