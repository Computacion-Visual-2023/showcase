This phenomenon is caused by the chromatic induction effect &amp;ldquo;the change in perceived color of a light caused by a nearby inducing stimulus&amp;rdquo;. The following illusion works based on chromatic induction. The square is always a pink color, however the background tricks your eye, making you think that the pink is getting lighter and darker as it move up and down the canvas.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Optical-illusions/kinegram/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Optical-illusions/kinegram/</guid><description>Kinegram # Introduction # Animation has been an art form that has fascinated people for centuries. From traditional animation techniques like cel animation to the more modern digital animation, the medium has continued to evolve and inspire. One such animation technique that has been around for over a century is the kinegram, also known as barrier-grid animation or picket-fence animation. Kinegrams have a rich history that can be traced back to the discovery of moiré patterns and development of Ombro-Cinéma toys.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Optical-illusions/stereokinetic-effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Optical-illusions/stereokinetic-effect/</guid><description>Stereokinetic Effect # Introduction # The Stereokinetic Effect is an optical illusion that allows flat images to appear as if they are three-dimensional. It works by manipulating the way our brains perceive depth and motion. By carefully placing and moving 2D shapes and figures, we can trick our brains into perceiving depth where there is none. This effect can be achieved through a variety of methods, including the use of contrasting colors, patterns, and shapes.</description></item></channel></rss>
