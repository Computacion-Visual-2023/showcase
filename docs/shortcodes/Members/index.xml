I am interested in living and creating valuable experiences for myself and other sentient or thinking beings. I am passionate about the movement of the human body, temporal, spatial and conceptual structures. I cultivate mushrooms, practice parkour, make music, write poetry and aphorisms, and try to educate myself as a scientist.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Members/marcos-macias/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Members/marcos-macias/</guid><description>Marcos Mac√≠as # About me # I am 26 years old. I enjoy watching movies and series to relax, nothing too complex or difficult to digest at the moment. I also like to play video games, although I am not an expert and do not know much diversity of them. I like to listen to music and dream of traveling to other countries to experience different parts of the world.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Members/paula-cadena/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Computacion-Visual-2023.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/Members/paula-cadena/</guid><description>Paula Alejandra Cadena Espitia # About me # I am Alejandra, I have always preferred my second name, it feels less serious than &amp;ldquo;Paula&amp;rdquo;, I have always felt at home on the computer, my safe place if you will, which is how I ended up here, I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, I love ttrpgs they are my main creative outlet and I hope to use my technical knowledge to help my favorite hobby become even more accessible to everyone.</description></item></channel></rss>
